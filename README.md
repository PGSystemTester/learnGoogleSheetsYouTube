# Souce Code From Learn Google Sheets
This is the source code from [Learn Google Sheets](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnGoogleSpreadsheets) who makes absolutely first rate videos on YouTube. I've modified the code slightly in a few instances where I thought was helpful, but overall the code should be almost the same, including variables, functions, page layout.  I'm posting this to help some kids learn a bit, but I **implore** you to consider supporting the creator's channel as he truly does first rate work.

## Ways To Support Creator (not me)
Don't be one of those people that grabs code, and silently thinks *this is cool* and disappars into the internet void leaving the creator no wiser that you have been helped.  All code in this depository comes from the youTube channel [Learn Google Sheets & Excel Spreadsheets](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnGoogleSpreadsheets). Please consider supporting the channel in any of the methods described below. 

### Subcribe to channel
[Learn Google Sheets & Excel Spreadsheets](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnGoogleSpreadsheets). Go subscribe. This costs you nothing and if you found this code helpful, you'd probably benefit getting more information. 

### Drop Like To Videos 
*It takes no more than 12 seconds to go to one of these pages and give the video a like, **and costs you nothing!***
These videos have source code posted in repository:

 - [Crude Web App Part 2](https://youtu.be/1CSPpsBGlQ0)

### Financial Donations
The creator accepts paypal donations. Go to the creator's [*about Me YouTube*](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnGoogleSpreadsheets/about) page, which links to the paypal donation. A direct for link from me should be considered suspicious.

## More Code?
I've reached out to the creator about this project, but have not received a response on if source code is anywhere else that he would prefer to take credit for, but have not received a response (if this is creator, please search for an email text Q397T7pZYNMDN8 in it).

If you'd like to submit more code, feel free to request to contribute.
